Goal for this project was to be implementing a simple AI that does the following

    a) accepts three arguments:

        i) first argument: a text file that contains a list of tuples that are <keyword responseword happiness>

        ii) second argument: a text file that contains a N messages .

        iii) third argument: a text file where the output will be stored.

    b) After reading in the first text file, it will go through each message in the second file, and if the message contains one of the 'keywords' from the first file, it will immediately respond with the appropriate message (depending on whether the corresponding 'keyword' makes the AI happy or not), along with the corresponding 'response' word. If more than one 'keyword' is included in the message, multiple responses will be made.

    c) Each response will be stored in the third text file.


Implemented the following:

    a. HappyResponse class definition in response.h

    b. bool Response::checkAndRespond(const string& inWord, ostream& toWhere) function

    c. void Response::respond(ostream& toWhere)

    d. AngryResponse method that 'responds' to a given output stream

    e. HappyResponse method that 'responds' to a given output stream.
 

TESTING:
(There is two different test directories: test1/ and test2/)


	input.txt contains the tuples, message.txt contains the messages, and result.txt contains the answer that should be same with the ouput.
