Goal for this assignment was to be implementing BFS using

    a) a linked list, and

    b) sparse matrix-vector multiply (i.e., using an adjacency matrix).

Implemented Functions:

    a) void construct_adj_list(int** adj_mat, int rows, int cols, adj_node_t*** list);

    b) void bfs(adj_node_t** list, int rows, int source, int* color, int* distance, int* parent);

    c) void bfs_spmv(int** int_array, int rows, int cols, int source, int* color, int* distance)

    i) void matrix_transpose(int** dst, int** src, int rows, int cols);

TESTING:
(There is two different test directories: test1/ and test2/)

    a) test1.txt (or test2.txt) are the files containing the adjacency matrix of the graph

    b) ans_X.txt is the answer (i.e., distance from the source) where X is the source vertex.
