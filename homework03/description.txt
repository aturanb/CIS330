Implemented a parallelized Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication(using openMP) and a conversion from COO to CSR.

Implemented Functions:

    a) convert_coo_to_csr(row_ind, col_ind, val, m, n, nnz, &csr_row_ptr, &csr_col_ind, &csr_vals);

    b) spmv(csr_row_ptr, csr_col_ind, csr_vals, m, n, nnz, vector_x, res);

TESTING:
(There is two different test directories: test1/ and test2/)

    a) A.mtx is the sparse matrix.

    b) x.mtx is the vector that you are multiplying the matrix with (i.e., A * x)

    c) ans.mtx is the answer to A*x. 

    <output> of the ./spmv <sparse matrix> <vector> <output> should be identical to ans.mtx.
