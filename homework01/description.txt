Implemented the function 'find_file()' which recursively searches the provided directory and its subdirectories to locate any file that matches the provided file name.

Testing:

   Executing './a.out . b.out' should generate the same output as what is shown in the 'ans1' file.

   Executing './a.out . a.out' should generate the same output as what is shown in the 'ans2' file.
